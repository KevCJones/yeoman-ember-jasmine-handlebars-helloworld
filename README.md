yeoman-ember-jasmine-handlebars-helloworld
==========================================

My personal hello world project using yeoman to create an Ember project with jasmine testing and handlebar compilation. 
I thought this would good for me to put up as a starting point for other projects.

*Disclaimer* 
============
All i've done here is pull together something that i can start from. 
I make no claim i've added anything and i'm still getting used to git, so if i've wronged someone just 
let me know why and how to fix it. Cheers :)

Getting Started
===============

1. Make sure you have setup Yeoman - visit yeoman.io
2. ``$ yeoman clean`` Will perform the workaround for handlebars auto building
3. ``$ yeoman clean`` As normal will run with the compiled handlebars and watch for changes
